# Sensitivity Analysis with Multiple Processes (SA-MP): Simultaneous Global Sensitivity Analysis of Model Variables and Model Structures
*by Juliane Mai, James R Craig, and Bryan A Tolson (University of Waterloo, Canada)*

## Abstract
Work in progress...

## Step-by-step tutorial
The step-by-step tutorial describes all the steps to estimate sensitivity indexes for a model that allows for multiple process options such as the hydrologic modeling framework [RAVEN](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca). It explains step-by-step on how to setup and adjust the provided codes. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/julemai/SA-MP/wiki/Step-by-step-tutorial).

## Examples
We provide the examples that were used in our publication:
- Benchmark model (see [here](https://github.com/julemai/SA-MP/wiki/Examples#benchmark-model))
- RAVEN modeling framework (see [here](https://github.com/julemai/SA-MP/wiki/Examples#raven-hydrologic-modeling-framework))

## Setup your own model
This section provides you with a guideline on how to setup your own model and run a sensitivity analysis for your model. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/julemai/SA-MP/wiki/Setup-your-own-model).
